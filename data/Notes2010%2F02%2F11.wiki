* In "More Fearless Change" we are concentrating more on the emotional connection that the evangelist or the energizer or the people helping the evangelist need to make with people that they are trying to convince
* *"Wake Up Call" *Pattern: appeals to "Oh, gosh there is a problem, there is really a problem, we need to solve this problem" rather than concentrating on the solution "I have an idea" and then people don't understand what's the emotional connection to the problem that they need to solve
* *"Myth Buster"*, because we recognize that when people see an idea in a certain way they are very connected to what they believe and so it is up to the Evangelist or the Energizer to break those myths the things that people believe which are not true about the idea
*  *"Imagine That"* where we are helping people imagine we suggest helping people imagine what the future would be like with this new idea
* *"Town Meeting"* which gets people together talking about the problem similar to what Obama has done with the healthcare issue.
* *"Fear-Less," *where you bring the skeptics on board and discuss how you can actually solve the problem and get their point of view.

* *"That was great". * evangelist may put on a nice outfit and do a wonderful power point presentation and there are people in the room that go "Wow, that was really good" and the evangelist is mistaken in thinking that is all he/she needs to do and he/she is definitely convinced that the people who were there in the room with wide-eyes going "That was great". But indeed people go back to their lives, their work lives and they forget
* *"Big Jolt Speaker,"* you can bring in somebody from the outside who is well known who will talk about the new idea and people tend to listen to others from the outside, rather than in your organization. So those two methods are good except that they can't be used alone. 
* 
*  *"Personal Touch" *in other words walking up to Mike and say "Let's look at how this new idea can match what Mike needs" and so explaining it to Mike that way, personal touch which would be different than how the evangelist might explain it to Sue, Sue has a different set of problems at work so you mentioned Agile, how Agile would meet Susan's needs and then Fred, how Agile might need Fred's needs.
* *"Bridge Builder"* pattern comes in so the people who are already convinced of the new idea can help you do some of this personal touch talking to people, seeing how the ideas such as Agile matches their pain and unfortunately we don't do enough of that because it's easier to do the power point, it's easier to do bringing an outside speaker, and that's important to do, but personal touch is another way to get the word out.
